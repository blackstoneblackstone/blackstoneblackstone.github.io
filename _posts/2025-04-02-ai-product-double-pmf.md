# AI Products Need to Break Through Two PMFs to Survive

In the traditional product world, we often talk about finding PMF (Product Market Fit), which means your product truly meets market needs. But in the AI product world, things get more complex—AI products need to break through two PMFs to truly survive.

## What is Double PMF?

For AI products, we need to consider two layers of PMF:

### 1. Model Layer PMF (Model-Market Fit)

First, the AI model itself needs to match real-world problems. This means:

- **Technical Capability Match**: The model's core capabilities (such as understanding, generating, or predicting) must reach the basic level required to solve specific problems
- **Data Quality Match**: Training data needs to truly reflect users' actual scenarios
- **Inference Effect Match**: Model output must align with user mental models and expectations

If the model layer PMF falls short, users will encounter the "AI isn't smart enough" problem—such as generative AI producing content far from expectations, or prediction accuracy being too low.

### 2. Product Layer PMF (Product-Market Fit)

Even if the model performs excellently, the product layer must also find market fit:

- **User Experience Match**: Interaction methods must be simple and intuitive, lowering usage barriers
- **Feature Match**: Product functions need to solve users' real pain points
- **Business Model Match**: Achieve sustainable profitability, balancing costs and value

## Why AI Products Easily Fail?

Many AI products fail because they focus on only one layer of PMF:

### Failure Cases Focusing Only on the Model Layer

Some technology-oriented teams overly focus on model performance metrics while neglecting real user needs. They might boast:

- "Our BLEU/ROUGE scores exceed SOTA!"
- "Our model has twice as many parameters as competitors!"

However, these technical metric improvements don't directly translate to user value. Like some early intelligent assistants, though technically advanced, they had mediocre user experiences and ultimately became "tech demos" rather than practical tools.

### Failure Cases Focusing Only on the Product Layer

On the other hand, some product-oriented teams might try to create excellent user experiences with poor models, resulting in users frequently encountering AI capability shortfalls:

- Natural language understanding is too poor to accurately respond to user intent
- Generated content quality is subpar, requiring significant manual editing
- Prediction accuracy is low, causing users to distrust the system

## How to Break Through Double PMF?

To build successful AI products, we need to simultaneously break through both layers of PMF:

### 1. Model Layer Breakthrough Strategies

- **Problem Focus**: Choose a sufficiently vertical domain for the model to learn focused knowledge
- **Data Quality Priority**: Better to have less but high-quality data than large but messy datasets
- **Closed-Loop Optimization**: Establish rapid feedback mechanisms, continuously learning from user usage
- **Incremental Iteration**: Avoid pursuing perfection at once, improve performance through continuous iteration

### 2. Product Layer Breakthrough Strategies

- **Find the "Just Enough" Capability Threshold**: Clearly define the minimum capability requirements valuable to users
- **Expectation Management**: Clearly communicate what the product can and cannot do
- **Hybrid Human-Machine Systems**: Appropriately introduce human intervention where AI capabilities are insufficient
- **Focus on Core Scenarios**: Excel in a few high-value scenarios first

## Case Analysis

### Success Case: GitHub Copilot

The key to Copilot's success lies in breaking through both layers of PMF:

- **Model Layer**: The CodeX model reached a practical level in code generation, understanding programming context
- **Product Layer**: Seamlessly integrated into the development environment, providing suggestions in completion form, not interrupting the development process, and lowering the cost of trial and error

### Failure Case: A Vertical Domain Q&A Assistant

A certain industry AI Q&A assistant failed because:

- **Model Layer**: General large models applied directly, without industry data fine-tuning, limited understanding of professional questions
- **Product Layer**: Despite a beautiful interface, frequent error responses caused users to lose trust

## Conclusion

For AI products to succeed, they must overcome the challenges of two PMFs. Technology and product teams need to work closely together, balancing technological possibilities with user needs, finding that intersection where AI technology truly creates value.

In the AI era, not all problems are suitable for AI solutions, and not all AI technologies can immediately generate business value. The key to success lies in finding the best fit between technical capabilities and user needs, then continuously improving both layers of PMF through optimization and iteration.
